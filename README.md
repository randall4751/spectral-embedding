# Graph Node Spectral Embeddings

A short tutorial in the form of a Jupyter Lab notebook on how to create embeddings for graph nodes. It generally follows the excellent presentation given by Tselil Schramm (Simons Institute) in 2017 and found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Afa1WI3iug.

# Computing Graph Triangles and Local Clustering Coefficients

A short tutorial on how to compute graph triangles from a graph adjacency matrix and then use that information to compute the Local Clustering Coefficient for each node.
