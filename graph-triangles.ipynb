    "# Counting Graph Triangles\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and counting triangles in a graph is a useful way to detect communities in social networks. Triangle counts are also used to compute Local and Global Clustering Coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphs, Vertices and Edges\n",
    "Generally, a graph is defined as $ùê∫=(ùëâ,ùê∏)$ where $ùëâ$ is a set of vertices and $ùê∏$ is a set of edges representing connections between vertices. The terms vertex and node are used interchangably, as well as the terms edge and arc. There are myriad variations of graph types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the graphs used in this notebook are limited to simple graphs, i.e. graphs where there can exist at most one, undirected and un-labeled edge between any two verticies. Additionally, node labels will consist of the integers $[0 .. N-1]$ where N is the number of nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Triangles\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph triangle is a 3-node subgraph where there exists an edge between each of the three node pairs, i.e. a fully-connected 3-node subgraph. A special property of the graph adjacency matrix is used to compute the number of triangles in a simple graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph adjacency matrix, $A$, for an N-node graph is an NxN matrix where the rows and columns represent the graph nodes, and connections between nodes are marked with an entry of 1. For instance, if node $i$ is connected to node $j$, then a 1 will appear at $A[i,j]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward way to store a graph representation is as an edge list. In this file format, each line consists of two, space-separated labels representing an edge between two nodes in the graph, the first label being the edge source, the second the destination. The following function will read a simplified edge-list file (where node labels are a contiguous set of integers), and return the corresponding adjacency matrix.\n",
